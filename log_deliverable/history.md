**Action Summary**:
- **Repository Cleanup**: Removed accidentally pushed `.DS_Store` files from the new repository and updated `.gitignore` to prevent future tracking.
- **Enhanced 3D Workflow**: Implemented a "Copy Layout JSON" utility in Leva that logs the entire scene configuration to the console for easy persistence.
- **Granular Asset Controls**: Refactored `Desk.jsx` and `App.jsx` to provide independent position, rotation, and scale controls for every new asset (Gavel, Notebook, etc.).
- **Scene Editor Mode**: Effectively turned the browser into a high-fidelity 3D editor, addressing user frustrations with asset placement complexity.
